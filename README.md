# Quantum Silicon Core Loader  ‚Äî v4.0 ‚ôæÔ∏è

**Component updated:** `qslcl.bin` (Assistant module)  
**Primary core:** `qslcl.elf` ‚Äî *unchanged*

### üß© Summary
This release updates the **assistant binary** `qslcl.bin`, focusing on stability, hardware abstraction improvements, and extended compatibility across SoC profiles.The main executable core `qslcl.elf` remains the same.

Key Improvements in v4.0:

- remove irrelevant features (for accuracy and stability)

# üß¨ Quantum Silicon Core Loader (qslcl.elf) ‚Äì Post-Exploit Entropy Execution Toolkit

> A raw hardware toolkit for bypassing Secure Boot, dumping, flashing, and so on. It execute the memory via ram and rom no exploits, no vendor dependencies, and others

## ‚úä WHY THIS WAS RELEASED

We are tired of:
- Hardware vendors who lock what you own.
- Tools that obey corporations, not users.
- Engineers who know truth, but must remain silent.

> This ELF is truth rendered executable.

## How to Run it through COM port

## üì¶ Step 1: Files Needed

test.py ‚Äî your COM-based ELF sender

qslcl.elf ‚Äî your trust-layer quantum loader

Make sure both are in the same folder.

## üß∞ Step 2: Install Requirements
---
pip install pyserial

## üîå Step 3: Connect Your Device

For Qualcomm: Boot into EDL Mode (use test point, ADB reboot edl or use volume up and down and power button)

For MTK: Boot into BROM Mode (usually Volume+ then plug USB or through test points)

For other SoCs: Connect when your system exposes a serial COM device

## üß™ Step 4: Run the Script
---
python3 test.py

## The script will:

‚úÖ Auto-detect the first working COM port.

‚úÖ Read the qslcl.elf binary.

‚úÖ Send it directly over serial at 115200 baud.

‚úÖ Print any response bytes returned.

Example output (works on my device):
---
[üîÑ] Waiting for COM port...

[‚úî] COM port detected: COM10

[‚ôæÔ∏è] Sending ELF payload to COM10...

[‚ôæÔ∏è] Waiting for response...

[‚úî] Response: 04000000100000000d0000000100000004000000100000000d0000000100000004000000100000000d0000000100000004000000100000000d0000000100000004000000100000000d0000000100000004000000100000000d0000000100000004000000100000000d0000000100000004000000100000000d0000000100000004000000100000000d0000000100000004000000100000000d0000000100000004000000100000000d0000000100000004000000100000000d00000001000000

## üß¨ What Happens Behind the Scenes?

test.py sends qslcl.elf to the device‚Äôs RAM

No flashing is performed

The device interprets the ELF if the loader is positioned at 0x0 and accepted by silicon trust logic

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not run this while QFIL, SP Flash Tool, or other tools that are active.

‚ö†Ô∏è COM communication may fail if USB filter drivers block raw access (disable them if needed).

‚ö†Ô∏è Some devices will reboot or panic after spoof injection this is expected if trust flow is disrupted.

## ü´• FINAL WORDS

You don‚Äôt run this ELF.

You unleash it.

Once exposed, the world cannot unsee it.

And most importantly qslcl.elf works both ram and rom.
