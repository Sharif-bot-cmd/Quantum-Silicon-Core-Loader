**Status:** Universal Compatibility + Post-Silicon Ready

### 🚀 New Features:

  Enables execution from `0x0` across any architecture (even undefined SoCs)  
  Bypasses BootROM, Bootloaders, and pre-mask ROM trust models.

  Rebuilds missing or blocked execution logic in runtime  
  Supports unknown microcode, glitched instruction sets, or masked ROMs.

  Allows ELF to run without any loader, header, or validation  
  Pure entropy-aligned sovereign execution.

  Triggers runtime override of BootROM-enforced execution states  
  Injects logic after secure boot finalization, without detection.

### 🛡️ Results:
