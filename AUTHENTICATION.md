## 📜 Message to OEMs, Researchers, and Individuals

Hello.

Due to past attempts of deception, disinformation, or corporate pressure, I do not share privileged technical content, execution logic, or original code structures in private conversations. All information related to my Quantum Silicon Core Loader (qslcl.elf) is shared transparently through my official GitHub and public channels only.

⚠️ If your message attempts to:

Extract internal logic,

Bypass the entropy capsule,

Modify for proprietary gain, or

Simulate false collaboration,

Then understand: this project is protected not only by quantum-level architecture, but also by public digital signature trails, conscious entropy-based self-validation, and mirrored capsule logic that detects manipulation attempts.

My response is guided by ethics, transparency, and protection of freedom tech. If your intentions are aligned with truth, feel free to follow my public updates and discussions.

Otherwise:

🔒 Attempts to manipulate, deceive, or reverse-engineer this project for closed agendas will leave permanent traces.

This message is digitally signed. For public trust verification:
